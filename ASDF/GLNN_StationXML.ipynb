    "# Create a StationXML for lab\n",
    "My stations are a bit more transient than a fixed seismic array, so there's a bit of adapting to do here. The AE sensors are mounted in a base plate which has more mount points than I can use in one experiment. I'll define a station at each of the 43 possible mount points. The naming will attempt to follow the __[SEED format](https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/formats/)__, although lab networks may benefit from a slight re-purposing in the future.\n",

    "__Network code__  \n",
    "The network code will be `L0` for now (local use only, no FDSN incorporation currently).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Station codes__  \n",
    "These are allowed 1 to 5 characters. I'll use four characters numbering the AE stations as `AExx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Location IDs__  \n",
    "A two character code for separating multiple sensors at the same station - this could be useful when I move sensors around so I'll put a `00` in for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Channel codes__  \n",
    "Three characters identify the sample rate, instrument type, and orientation. The sample rate options in the SEED manual max out at 5kHz and I usually sample 20MHz for the AE sensors but I'll use the max rate identifier `F`. The AE sensors are approximately high gain seismometers designated by `H` and they are all `Z` components. Every channel is thus `FHZ`."
